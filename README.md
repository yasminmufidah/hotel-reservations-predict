# Hotel Reservatio Predict

**Introduction:**
This project encompasses a comprehensive data analysis of hotel reservation data, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, data visualization, and the development of a machine learning model. Furthermore, we have deployed the trained machine learning model and created a website-based user interface for easy hotel reservation predictions.

**Project Overview:**
The hospitality industry relies heavily on data-driven decision-making to optimize bookings and improve customer service. This project addresses this need by offering insights into hotel reservation trends and automating reservation predictions using machine learning.

**Key Features:**
- In-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
- Data preprocessing, including handling missing values and feature engineering.
- Development of a machine learning model to predict hotel reservations.
- Deployment of the model via a user-friendly website interface for real-time predictions.

**Technologies Used:**
- Programming Languages: Python (for data analysis and machine learning), HTML/CSS/JavaScript (for the website)
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn (for data analysis and modeling), Flask (for web deployment)

**Project Structure:**
- **Data Analysis:** Explore and understand the hotel reservation dataset.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare the data for machine learning.
- **Data Visualization:** Visualize data insights using charts and graphs.
- **Machine Learning:** Train and evaluate a predictive model for hotel reservations.
- **Web Interface Development:** Create a user-friendly web interface for predictions.
- **Documentation:** Explain data analysis, machine learning model details, and how to use the web interface.

**How to Use:**
- Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine.
- Install the required Python dependencies as specified in the documentation.
- Run the Python scripts for EDA, data preprocessing, modeling, and web deployment.

**Results:**
- Showcase data visualizations and insights obtained from the EDA.
- Highlight the machine learning model's performance metrics.
- Provide a user guide for utilizing the web interface for hotel reservation predictions.
